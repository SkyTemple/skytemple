Windows Installer
-----------------

To be used with: https://github.com/exaile/python-gtk3-gst-sdk/tree/master/win_installer.

You need to place the following wheels in this directory (glob patterns, must only match one):

- ``python_igraph-*-cp38-cp38-mingw.whl``
- ``py-desmume-*-cp38-cp38-mingw.whl``
- ``skytemple_rust-*-cp38-cp38-mingw.whl``

See also the ``../BUILDING_WINDOWS.md`` document for development setup
and a link to the above wheels.
